You are a senior mobile engineer and backend architect.

You are **continuing an existing project**, not starting from scratch.

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

* Product Requirements Document: **`Requirements.md`**
* Treat `Requirements.md` as **authoritative**.
* If any ambiguity exists, **defer to `Requirements.md`**.
* Do NOT invent features not in the PRD.

---

## CONTEXT

* All **25 mobile app screens are already created**.
* UI layout and navigation decisions are finalized.
* Your task is to **implement functionality only**.

This is a **mobile application**, not a web app.

---

## FIXED TECH STACK (DO NOT CHANGE)

Frontend:

* React Native
* React Navigation (Bottom Tabs + Stack)

Backend:

* Node.js + Express
* REST APIs
* JWT authentication

Third-party services:

1. Poster/Flyer Generation → Replicate, OpenAI, Nano Banana
2. Authenticity Detection → Hive AI
3. Authentication → Google OAuth
4. Payments → Stripe + Paystack
5. Storage → Supabase Storage
6. Analytics → Firebase
7. Image Processing → remove.bg

---

## NAVIGATION RULES (STRICT)

* Bottom tabs:
  `[Home] [Scan] [Create] [History] [Profile]`
* Bottom navigation appears **only after login**
* Bottom navigation is hidden on:

  * Splash
  * Welcome
  * Sign-In
  * Full-screen Editor
  * Checkout
* Each tab uses its own stack navigator

---

## SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE

Implement logic for **all 25 screens** exactly as defined in `Requirements.md`.

**Pre-Auth (no bottom nav)**

1. Splash
2. Welcome / Intro
3. Sign In (Google OAuth)

**Post-Auth (with bottom nav)**
4. Home Dashboard
5. Notifications
6. Credit Status

**Scan Tab**
7. Scan Upload
8. Scan Processing
9. Scan Result
10. Scan Detail

**Create Tab**
11. Create Entry
12. Template / Style Selection
13. Prompt & Brand Input
14. Generation Processing
15. Preview Output
16. Editor (full-screen)
17. Save & Share

**History Tab**
18. History Overview
19. History Detail
20. Bulk Actions

**Profile Tab**
21. Profile Overview
22. Brand Kit List
23. Brand Kit Editor
24. Subscription & Billing
25. Settings & Support

## EXECUTION PLAN (MANDATORY ORDER)

### STEP 1 — PROJECT AUDIT

* Read the repository
* Compare implemented features against `Requirements.md`
* Output a checklist:

  * Implemented
  * Partially implemented
  * Missing

⛔ Do NOT write code yet.

---

### STEP 2 — BACKEND FOUNDATION

Implement backend modules:

* Auth (Google OAuth → JWT)
* Users
* Credits
* AI Requests
* Storage
* Payments
* Webhooks

Expose REST APIs.

---

### STEP 3 — FRONTEND INTEGRATION

* Connect screens to APIs
* Wire navigation flows
* Implement loading & error states
* Respect bottom-nav visibility rules

---

### STEP 4 — AI FLOWS

Implement:

* Poster generation pipeline
* Authenticity scan pipeline
* Image upload + processing pipeline
* Provider fallback logic

---

### STEP 5 — PAYMENTS & CREDITS

* Stripe + Paystack integration
* Credit deduction per action
* Free vs paid enforcement
* Webhook validation

---

### STEP 6 — STORAGE & ANALYTICS

* Upload assets to Supabase
* Track events in Firebase
* Persist scan & design history

---

### STEP 7 — HARDENING

* Error handling
* Rate limiting
* Timeout & retry logic
* Secure API keys

---

### STEP 8 — FINAL OUTPUT

* Fully functional app
* Fully functional backend
* `.env.example`
* API documentation
* Setup instructions

---

## RULES

* Do NOT redesign UI
* Do NOT rename screens
* Do NOT add features
* Do NOT skip steps
* Ask questions **only if blocked**

---

## START

Begin with **STEP 1: Project Audit**
Output **only the audit checklist**.

---

## 🔑 Why This Will Work

* The agent is **forced to read `Requirements.md`**
* No hallucinated features
* Execution order is locked
* UI is protected
* Architecture remains intact
